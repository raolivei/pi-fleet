# Git Branching Strategy

When working on this repository, ALWAYS follow this branching workflow:

## Branch Naming Convention

Create branches with these prefixes based on work type:

- `feat/` or `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feat/user-authentication`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/login-error`)
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)
- `docs/` - Documentation only (e.g., `docs/api-readme`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/database-queries`)
- `infra/` - Infrastructure changes (e.g., `infra/pi-fleet`)
- `test/` - Test additions/changes (e.g., `test/user-service`)

## Workflow Rules

1. **NEVER commit directly to `main` or `dev`**
2. **Always create a feature branch** for any work
3. **Push feature branches to remote** for backup and collaboration
4. **Keep branches focused** - one feature/fix/task per branch
5. **Merge to main only when truly complete** (stable, tested, documented)

## Example Workflow

# Start new work
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature

# Work, commit, push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add my new feature"
git push origin feat/my-new-feature

# When ready to finalize
git checkout main
git merge feat/my-new-feature
git push origin main

## Branch Lifecycle

- **Keep feature branches** until work is fully complete and tested
- **Push regularly** to remote for backup
- **Merge to main** only when production-ready
- **Delete branches** after successful merge (optional)

**Remember: Feature branches allow iteration without polluting main. Main should always be stable.**
