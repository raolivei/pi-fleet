# Vault HA Configuration with Raft Integrated Storage
# Updated: January 27, 2026
#
# This configuration runs Vault in HA mode with:
# - 3 replicas (one per node)
# - Raft integrated storage (data replicated across nodes)
# - Local NVMe storage (Raft handles replication - no need for Longhorn!)
# - Anti-affinity to spread pods across nodes
#
# Why local-path instead of Longhorn?
# - Raft already replicates data across all 3 nodes
# - Local NVMe is faster than network-replicated storage
# - No Multi-Attach errors or Longhorn complexity
# - Each vault pod has its own local copy via Raft consensus
#
# Unseal keys are stored in K8s secret: vault-unseal-keys
# Initialize with: ./scripts/operations/init-vault-ha.sh
# Unseal with: ./scripts/operations/unseal-vault.sh
