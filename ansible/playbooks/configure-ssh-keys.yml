# DEPRECATED: This playbook is deprecated in favor of setup-ssh-keys.yml
# 
# setup-ssh-keys.yml now includes all functionality from this playbook:
# - Generates SSH keys on nodes
# - Adds node keys to other nodes (node-to-node communication)
# - Optionally adds local machine's key (use -e add_local_key=true)
#
# Migration:
#   OLD: ansible-playbook playbooks/configure-ssh-keys.yml
#   NEW: ansible-playbook playbooks/setup-ssh-keys.yml -e add_local_key=true
#
# This file is kept for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future version.
